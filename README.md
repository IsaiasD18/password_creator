## Description

Have you ever been in a situation where you can't decide what to put in for your password?
Well, I have the solution! I have created a password generator website. This website will allow you to get a simple password within few clicks. Its concise and easy, just choose how many characters you want for your password (between 8 and 128), and you can choose if you want a mix of different characters of just one. Don't forget that you must choose a least one of the options. I hope this helps finding your perfect password.


## Installation
